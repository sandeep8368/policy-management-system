This is a real-world Django REST API project designed for managing insurance policies and claims. It includes user registration/login using JWT, policy creation, claim submissions, and a notification system that alerts users if their policy is about to expire within 15 days.

The system uses modern Django features such as:

Class-based views (CBVs)

Function-based views (FBVs)

Signals

Prefetching for query optimization

Forms and ModelForms for admin integration
